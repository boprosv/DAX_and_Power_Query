# DAX_and_Power_Query
Dax and Power Query Assistant


In this project I created this Streamlit-powered AI assistant that bridges the gap between natural language and Power BI development by instantly generating DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and Power Query (M) code from plain English requests. Designed for data analysts, BI developers, and Excel/Power BI users, it accelerates report development while maintaining best practices.
